== Install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio
This lab will guide you how to install Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS) and the tools for creating data views that are accessible through standard protocols (the Teiid Designer plug-in for JBDS and connect Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization server.

If you don't already have Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 9.1.0, download it from  https://developers.redhat.com/download-manager/file/jboss-devstudio-9.1.0.GA-installer-eap.jar[https://developers.redhat.com/download-manager/file/jboss-devstudio-9.1.0.GA-installer-eap.jar].
You can use either the installer which includes JBoss EAP (jboss-devstudio-9.1.0.GA-installer-eap.jar) or the stand-alone installer (jboss-devstudio-9.1.0.GA-installer-standalone.jar). 
The instructions below is using the installer with EAP.

Run the JBDS installer using the java command.
The required JBDS version is 9.1.0.GA to be used with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3.0, and run the installer with the following command see below.

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar jboss-devstudio-9.1.0.GA-installer-eap.jar
----

Follow the installer prompts to complete the installation process.

image::2.1-JBDS-install-restart.png[]

The Software Updates window appears. Press the btn:[Yes] button to restart Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to apply the changes to take effect.

Now that you have JBoss Data Virtualization and JBoss Developer Studio successfully installed, it is time to “hook up” JBoss Developer Studio to the JBoss Data Virtualization server instance.

If the Servers pane is not already visible in JBoss Developer Studio, you can open it by menu:Window[Show View > Other > Server > Servers]. The Show View window is presented below.

image::2.2-JBDS-servers.png[]

Now, click the btn:[OK] button. The Servers pane will now be visible in the lower portion of JBoss Developer Studio and is displayed below.

image::2.2-JBDS.png[]

Now, it is a matter of clicking through several screens to add the JBoss Data Virtualization server instance that was installed as part of Lab 1. Click the link “No servers are available. Click this link to create a new server...” and following window will appear:

image::2.2-JBDS-add-server.png[]

With the New Server wizard enabled, be sure you entries look like those above. Select JBoss Enterprise
Middleware -> JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1+ as the server type. You can keep the defaults that are selected or enter the values appropriate for your workstation. In this case, “localhost” is entered for Server’s host name and “Create Runtime Server” is entered for the Server name. Change the Server name into a meaningful name like "JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3.0". Click the btn:[Next] button.
Next, the JBoss Runtime will need to be created. Essentially, this is selecting the “Home” directory for the JBoss Data Virtualization instance that was installed as part of Lab 1. The values to select are illustrated below.

image::2.2-JBDS-setup-runtime.png[]

Click btn:[Next]. Select the “home” directory for the JBoss Data Virtualization instance. This will be <path to installed instance>/jboss-eap-6.4. Once this runtime is selected, the available configurations are available. To keep things simple, select the “default” profile. 

image::2.2-JBDS-setup-runtime2.png[]

Click btn:[Finish]. 

The Servers pane will now have the available server available as indicated below.

image::2.2-JBDS-servers-pane.png[]

At this point, you can right-click on the server and there is a list of available options. Click menu:Start[] from the available options and the server will start up.

=== Open the Teiid Perspective
To begin this exercise, launch JBDS (if it is not already open), and open the “Teiid Designer” perspective. This is because the JBoss perspective is the default perspective.
To open the “Teiid Designer” perspective, first select menu:Window[Open Perspective > Other...] in order for the full list of perspectives to be displayed and the “Teiid Designer” perspective to be selectable.

image::2.3-JBDS-perspective.png[]

Select Teiid Designer from the perspective list as shown below.

image::2.3-JBDS-Teiid-designer.png[]

Click btn:[OK]. 
This will bring you to a screen that looks like this:

image::2.3-JBDS-Teiid-designer2.png[]

Connecting to a running Server instance is necessary to execute previews of the data services that we will create. In the Teiid Guides window select Teiid. 
In the Server tab open the tree node of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3.0 by clicking on arrow. This will set the Default Server automaticaly.

Click on the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3.0 link in the Default Server window and then click tab name Teiid Instance.

For the Teiid JDBC Connection Info, enter “localhost” for the host and enter teiidUser / redhat1! for the username / password. Keep the default port number. Also, be sure that the “Save” checkbox is marked. The “SSL” box should not be marked. Keep the default port number. When complete, your Teiid Server Connection Information should look like the illustration below.
As a “sanity” check, be sure to click the "Test Administration Connection" and "Test JDBC Connection" links. You should get a "OK" message. If you do not, please raise your hand. If it failed, it may be necessary to cancel and retry the steps again.

JBDS should look like the following illustration.

You can now begin creating your own Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization projects. 

Congratulations, you have now completed this lab.
