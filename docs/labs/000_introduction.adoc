== Introduction
Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization, formerly known as Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Data Services Platform (EDS), is a complete data provisioning, federation, integration and management solution that enables organizations to gain actionable and unified information. Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization enables agile data utilization in three steps:

.	Connect: Access data from multiple, heterogeneous data sources. 
.	Compose: Create reusable, business-friendly logical data models and views by combining and transforming data. 
.	Consume: Make unified data easily consumable through open standard interfaces.

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization (DV) includes:

* Tools for creating data views that are accessible through standard protocols. For those who are already familiar with Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization one of the tools is the Teiid Designer plug-in for Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS).
* A robust runtime environment that provides enterprise-class performance, data integrity, and security (the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization Server, which executes as a process within the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP)).
* A repository for storing metadata (ModeShape)

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is based on the following community projects:

* Teiid (http://www.jboss.org/teiid)
* Teiid Designer (http://www.jboss.org/teiiddesigner)
* ModeShape (http://www.jboss.org/modeshape)

The figure below depicts the architectural overview of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization:

|Component
|Description

|Query Engine
|The heart of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization Server is a high-performance query engine that processes relational, XML, XQuery and procedural queries from federated datasources. Features include support for homogeneous schemas, heterogeneous schemas, transactions, and user defined 

|Embedded
|An easy-to-use JDBC Driver that can embed the Query Engine in any Java application.

|Server
|An enterprise ready, scalable, manageable, runtime for the Query Engine that runs inside JBoss EAP that provides additional security, fault-tolerance, and administrative features.

|Connectors
|Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization Server includes a rich set of Translators and Resource Adapters that enable access to a variety of sources, including most relational databases, web services, text files, and ldap. 

Need data from a different source? Custom translators and resource adaptors can easily be developed.

|Tools
|Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization Server includes development and administration tools to

* Create - Use Teiid Designer to define virtual databases containing views, procedures or even dynamic XML documents. 
* Monitor & Manage - Use the Management Console with  JBoss EAP or use the JBoss Data Virtualization JBoss Operations Network (JON) plugin to control any number of servers. 
* Script - Use the AdminShell to automate administrative and testing tasks.

=== What is expected of you
Please know that all care was made in creating this user guide, but all screen shots and steps along the way might be off by just a little so please be patient with any issues.

Please feel free to raise your hands if you have any questions. Also feel free to ask why it is you are doing something, or if something doesn't feel right.

=== Prerequisites
Please make sure that the following software is installed and configured:

* Minimal version 1.7 of OpenJDK or Oracle JDK
* Git
* PostgreSQL server or MariaDB server
* If you are using a remote database the PostgreSQL or MariaDB client tools should be used.

=== Setup demo environment
In order to use the labs we need to prepare one database. We provided some database SQL scripts for PostgreSQL and MariaDB to load initial data into the database. In the next paragraph we will describe how to install the database and how to load the demo data into the database.

TIP: Use the database you prefer, it's not required to have them both installed.

==== Setup PostgreSQL
Installation

The easiest way to install PostgreSQL is to use the pre-built binary packages which are available for a number of different operating systems. See http://www.postgresql.org/download/ for more information and downloads.
Post-install steps:
[start=1]
. If *nix or MacOSX switch to user postgres or other OS user who is able to use psql command to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
[source,bash]
----
$ su postgres
----
[start=2]
. Go to the DVWorkshop/dv-docker/demo directory and run the following command:
[source,bash]
----
$ psql -a -f financials-psql.sql
----
[start=3]
. If Step 2 is successfully executed the the PostgreSQL environment contains the following databases. Hint: start the psql command line utility and type the “\l” to list the databases in PostgreSQL database.
[source,bash]
----
$ psql
psql (9.3.4, server 9.0.13)
Type "help" for help.

==== Setup MariaDB
Installation

The easiest way to install MariaDB is to use the pre-built binary packages which are available for a number of different operating systems. See https://downloads.mariadb.org for more information and downloads.

TODO: Will rewrite text below to mariadb after next week 

Post-install steps
[start=1]
. If *nix or MacOSX go to the /usr/local/mysql directory and start mysqld_safe
[source,bash]
----
$ cd /usr/local/mysql
$ sudo ./bin/mysqld_safe
----
[start=2]
. Go to the DVWorkshop/dv-docker/demo directory and tun the following command as depicted in the picture below.
[source,bash]
----
$ sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql < financials-mysql.sql
----
[start=3]
. If Step 2 is successfully executed the MariaDB environment contains the following databases. 
[source,bash]
----
sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql

The labs will use the following databases:

- apaccustomer
- brokerinfo
- eucustomers
- products
- uscustomers

Congratulations, you have completed this introduction lab.
