== Install Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 
There are three different ways to install Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization.

. Graphical mode: Graphical mode launches a graphical wizard which provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization. Additional setup, including the Quickstarts and Maven Repository, is also possible with the installer.
. Text mode: You can launch the installer in the text mode as well. Text mode provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization.
. Automated script mode: You can install multiple identical instances of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization using the automated script. This automated script is generated after the first installation instance. We will explain the graphical mode and automated script mode in more detail in the following paragraphs.

Next steps

In the Next steps we would like to include a PostgreSQL database to the application previously created on OpenShift Online.
The figure below is shown when the application is successfully created in your domain.

image::1.3-DV-OpenShift-app-create.png[]

Now we would like to add a PostgreSQL database to the application. Click the Application name link, in the above figure it's called “dv61”.
The following screen should appear.
