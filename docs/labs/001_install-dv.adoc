== Install Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 
There are three different ways to install Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization:

. Graphical mode: Graphical mode launches a graphical wizard which provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization. Additional setup, including the Quickstarts and Maven Repository, is also possible with the installer.
. Text mode: You can launch the installer in the text mode as well. Text mode provides step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization.
. Automated script mode: You can install multiple identical instances of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization using the automated script. This automated script is generated after the first installation instance. We will explain the graphical mode and automated script mode in more detail in the following paragraphs.
. Custom scripts: You can provide your own script in order to automate the installation of the required components of JBoss Data Virtualization. 

=== Installing Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization through graphical mode
Download the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization installer binary by clicking the green download button at http://www.jboss.org/products/datavirt.html.

NOTE: Starting from JBoss Data Virtualization 6.2.0 one need to install JBoss EAP 6.4.0 including patch 3 first before installing JBoss Data Virtualization 6.2.0. In earlier versions of JBoss Data Virtualization the JBoss EAP server was included in the JBoss DV distribution. So we need to install JBoss EAP first, so remember the directory where you downloaded JBoss DV, because we need it later on.

Install JBoss EAP 6.4.0

[source, bash]
----
$ unzip jboss-eap-6.4.0.zip
$ cd jboss-eap-6.4/bin
$ ./jboss-cli.sh
You are disconnected at the moment. Type 'connect' to connect to the server or 'help' for the list of supported commands.
[disconnected /]
----

NOTE: Skip apply patch 3 step when you have downloaded the software from http://jboss.org[jboss.org]. 

Apply patch 3 to previously installed JBoss EAP 6.4.0 environment

[source, bash]
----
[disconnected /] patch apply jboss-eap-6.4.3-patch.zip
{
    "outcome" : "success",
    "result" : {}
}
[disconnected /] exit
----
 
Open a terminal window and navigate to the location where the GUI installer was downloaded.
Run the installer using java at the command prompt: 

[source, bash]
----
$ java -jar jboss-dv-installer-6.2.0.redhat-2.jar
----

Follow the installer prompts to complete the installation process.

=== Installing Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization through automated script mode
Installing Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization by using an automated script provides everything you need to get you started quickly. 

Download the JBoss Data Virtualization installer binary by clicking the green download button at http://www.jboss.org/products/datavirt.html.

image::1.1-DV-download.png[]

Place the software in the software subfolder.

Modify the support/installscript_local.xml file to contain the full path to the preferred installation directory for JBoss Data Virtualization 6.2.0. 

[source,xml]
----
<installpath>/home/jboss/dv</installpath>
----

The script performs the automated install of JBoss Data Virtualization v6.2.0.GA.
Run the following java command to install JBoss Data Virtualization in as shown below.

[source, bash]
----
$ cd support
$ java -jar ../software/jboss-dv-installer-6.2.0.redhat-2.jar installscript_local.xml

Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is now successfully installed, configured and started using the automated script mode. 

=== Installing Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization through custom scripts
A colleague of mine Vijay Chintalapati created custom scripts to automates the deployment of all the required components of JBoss Data Virtualization on Windows, Linux and Unix environments for running this workshop.

The github repository Vijay created can be found here: https://github.com/vchintal/jboss-data-virtualization-setup[https://github.com/vchintal/jboss-data-virtualization-setup]

Follow the instructions mentioned in the repository to full automate the JBoss Data Virtualization installation.

=== Provision Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization on OpenShift Online
With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run JBoss Data Virtualization in minutes to connect your applications to data from many different sources. JBoss Data Virtualization on OpenShift Online is available as a Developer Preview to allow you to explore the capabilities of the technology running on OpenShift Online.

Get your free OpenShift Online account
Sign up for your free account OpenShift Online account at https://www.openshift.com/app/account/new and you should see the screen below.

image::1.3-DV-OpenShift.png[]

If you already have an OpenShift Online account please sign in with your known OpenShift Online username password combination.

Create a new application
If this is your first login into OpenShift Online click at the “-> Create your first application now” link

If you already have an OpenShift Online account click btn:[Add Application] below your list of applications. 
Alternatively, you can deploy the Data Virtualization 6 (jboss-dv-6.1.0) cartridge using the OpenShift RHC Client Tools. Using the rhc client tools type:

[source,bash]
----
$ rhc app create dv jboss-dv-6.1.0
----

Choose a type of applications

You can either scroll down to the list of quick links and click the btn:[JBoss Data Virtualization 6 (jboss-dv-6.1.0)] button under “xPaaS” or search for “Data”. 

image::1.3-DV-OpenShift-app.png[]

Configure Application

Name your application in your domain, scroll down and click the btn:[Create Application] button.

image::1.3-DV-OpenShift-config-app.png[]

Next steps

In the Next steps we would like to include a PostgreSQL database to the application previously created on OpenShift Online.
The figure below is shown when the application is successfully created in your domain.

image::1.3-DV-OpenShift-app-create.png[]

Now we would like to add a PostgreSQL database to the application. Click the Application name link, in the above figure it's called “dv61”.
The following screen should appear.

image::1.3-DV-OpenShift-add-psql.png[]

Click “Add PostgreSQL 9.2” 

image::1.3-DV-OpenShift-add-psql2.png[]

Click “Add Cartridge” to add PostgreSQL 9.2 to previously created dv61 environment.

You have now a successfully created a Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization environment with a PostgreSQL 9.2 database in just a matter of seconds.

Congratulations, you have now completed this lab.
