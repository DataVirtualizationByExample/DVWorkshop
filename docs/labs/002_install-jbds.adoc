. Click image:OkBTN-1.png[].

The workspace location prompting behavior can be altered at any time by clicking `Window` -> `Preferences`. Expand `General` -> `Startup and Shutdown` -> `Workspace`. Select or clear the Prompt for workspace on startup check box to alter the behavior as appropriate.

NOTE: After starting Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio you might get a informational message to inform you that there are updates available. 
Please upgrade to the latest patch version of Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio by clicking in the Update balloon message.

== Install JBoss Data Virtualization Development Tools 

The easiest way to install the JBoss Data Virtualization Development option in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio is to use Red Hat Central.

image:2.1-JBDS-jboss-central-1.png[]

Select `Help` -> `Red Hat Central` if Red Hat Central isn't active. Click the tab `Software/Update` and select the *JBoss Data Virtualization Development* option and click Install/Update.

image:2.1-JBDS-install-restart-1.png[]

The Software Updates window appears. Press the Yes button to restart Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio to apply the changes to take effect.

=== Set up JDV Server

Now that you have JBoss Data Virtualization and JBoss Developer Studio successfully installed, it is time to “hook up” JBoss Developer Studio to the JBoss Data Virtualization server instance.

If the Servers pane is not already visible in JBoss Developer Studio, you can open it by `Window` -> `Show View` -> `Other` -> `Server` -> `Servers`.

The Servers pane will now be visible in the lower portion of JBoss Developer Studio and is displayed below.

image:2.2-JBDS-servers.png[]

Now, it is a matter of clicking through several screens to add the JBoss Data Virtualization server instance that was installed as part of Lab link:001_install-dv.adoc[Install Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization].

Click the link `No servers are available. Click this link to create a new server...` and following window will appear:

image:2.2-JBDS-add-server-1.png[]

With the New Server wizard enabled, be sure you entries look like those above. 

Select `JBoss Enterprise Middleware` -> `JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1+` as the server type. You can keep the defaults that are selected or enter the values appropriate for your workstation. In this case, *localhost* is entered for Server’s host name. Change the Server name into a meaningful name like "JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3.0". 

Click the image:NextBTN-1.png[] button.

Next, Set the server adapter, use the default setting.

image:2.2-JBDS-setup-runtime-1.png[]

Click image:NextBTN-1.png[] to Set up JBoss runtime, Essentially, this is selecting the *Home* directory for the JBoss Data Virtualization instance that was installed as part of Lab link:001_install-dv.adoc[Install Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization]. The values to select are illustrated below:

image:2.2-JBDS-setup-runtime2-1.png[]

Click image:FinishBTN.png[]. 

The Servers pane will now have the available server available as indicated below.

image:2.2-JBDS-servers-pane-1.png[]

At this point, you can right-click on the server and there is a list of available options. Click *Start* from the available options and the server will start up. 

image:2.2-JBDS-menu-start.png[]

NOTE: If JBoss Data Virtualization Server is already started from the command line using standalone.sh or standalone.bat, JBoss Developer Studio will show a warning "Server already running on localhost", select option "Set the server adapter to 'started', without launching a new server."   

=== Open the Teiid Perspective

To begin this exercise, launch JBDS (if it is not already open), and open the *Teiid Designer* perspective. This is because the JBoss perspective is the default perspective.

To open the *Teiid Designer* perspective, first select `Window` -> `Perspective` -> `Open Perspective` -> `Other...` in order for the full list of perspectives to be displayed and the *Teiid Designer* perspective to be selectable.

image:2.3-JBDS-perspective.png[]

Select Teiid Designer from the perspective list as shown below.

image:2.3-JBDS-Teiid-designer.png[]

Click image:OkBTN-1.png[].
 
This will bring you to a screen that looks like this:

=== Connecting to Running JDV instance

Connecting to a running Server instance is necessary to execute previews of the data services that we will create. In the Teiid Guides window select Teiid. 

In the Server tab open the tree node of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3.0 by clicking on arrow. This will set the Default Server automaticaly.

image:2.3-JBDS-Teiid-designer-teiid-instance-config.png[]

Click on the Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.3.0 link in the Default Server window and then click tab name Teiid Instance.

image:2.3-JBDS-Teiid-designer-teiid-instance.png[]

For the Teiid JDBC Connection Info, enter “localhost” for the host and enter teiidUser / redhat1! for the username / password. Keep the default port number. Also, be sure that the “Save” checkbox is marked. The “SSL” box should not be marked. Keep the default port number. When complete, your Teiid Server Connection Information should look like the illustration below.
As a “sanity” check, be sure to click the "Test Administration Connection" and "Test JDBC Connection" links. You should get a "OK" message. If you do not, please raise your hand. If it failed, it may be necessary to cancel and retry the steps again.

JBDS should look like the following illustration.
