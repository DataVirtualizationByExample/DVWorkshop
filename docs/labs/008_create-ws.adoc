== Create a Web service

In this lab, you will be utilizing the Teiid Designer and JBDS to create a Web service. It should be noted that this lab is not a guide on Web services or how or when to use them. Rather, this is an instructional approach for some of the advanced capabilities of Teiid Designer.

In order to keep things organized, be sure to select “Browse” and select the WebServices folder we created in an earlier lab. This will drop all web service artifacts within this folder. Then, click btn:[Finish]. If the generation was successful, the following result will occur.

The generated Web Service will open after clicking btn:[OK]. Your Teiid Designer view should resemble that below.
