== Install JBoss Developer Studio
This lab will guide you how to install JBoss Developer Studio and the tools for creating data views that are accessible through standard protocols (the Teiid Designer plug-in for JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS) and connect JBoss Developer Studio to the JBoss Data Virtualization server.

If you don't already have JBoss Developer Studio 7.1.1, download it from https://www.jboss.org/products/jbds.html[https://www.jboss.org/products/jbds.html] by clicking the green download.

Now that you have JBoss Data Virtualization and JBoss Developer Studio successfully installed, it is time to “hook up” JBoss Developer Studio to the JBoss Data Virtualization server instance.

If the Servers pane is not already visible in JBoss Developer Studio, you can open it by menu:Window[Show View > Other > Server > Servers]. The Show View window is presented below.

Now, click the btn:[OK] button. The Servers pane will now be visible in the lower portion of JBoss Developer Studio and is displayed below.

Now, it is a matter of clicking through several screens to add the JBoss Data Virtualization server instance that was installed as part of Lab 1. Click the link “No servers are available. Click this link to create a new server...” and following window will appear:

image::2.2-JBDS-add-server.png[]

With the New Server wizard enabled, be sure you entries look like those above. Select JBoss Enterprise
Middleware -> JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.1+ as the server type. You can keep the defaults that are selected or enter the values appropriate for your workstation. In this case, “localhost” is entered for Server’s host name and “JBoss EAP 6.1+ Runtime Server” is entered for the Server name. Change the Server name into a meaningful name. Click the btn:[Next] button.
Next, the JBoss Runtime will need to be defined. Essentially, this is selecting the “home” directory for the JBoss Data Virtualization instance that was installed as part of Lab 1. The values to select are illustrated below.
Select the “home” directory for the JBoss Data Virtualization instance. This will be <path to installed instance>/jboss-eap-6.1. Once this runtime is selected, the available configurations are available. To keep things simple, select the “default” profile.

Click btn:[Finish]. 

The Servers pane will now have the available server available as indicated below.

At this point, you can right-click on the server and there is a list of available options. Click menu:Start[] from the available options and the server will start up.
